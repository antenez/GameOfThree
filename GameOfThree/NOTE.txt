Game of Three ‐ Coding Challenge

Goal
The Goal is to implement a game with two independent units – the players – communicating with each other using an API.
Description
When a player starts, it incepts a random (whole) number and sends it to the second player as an approach of starting the game.
The receiving player can now always choose between adding one of {­1, 0, 1}to get to a number that is divisible by 3. Divide it by three. The resulting whole number is
then sent back to the original sender. The same rules are applied until one player reaches the number 1(after the division).
See example below.

For initial 65 sent to player 2, player two play +1, return 57/3=19
Player 1 play -1, sent 18/3=6
Player 2 play +0 sent 6/3=2
Player one play +1, and 2+1 = 3 /3 =1 and he win game.

For each "move", a sufficient output should get generated (mandatory: the added, and
the resulting number).

Both players should be able to play automatically without user input. One of the players
should optionally be adjustable by a user.

Notes
● Each player runs on its own (independent programs, two browsers, web‐workers,...).
● Communication via an API (REST, Sockets, WebRTC, ...).
● A player may not be available when the other one starts.
● If you are applying for a frontend position, think of a fancy easily configurable layout. Otherwise terminal output is okay.
● Please share your project on GitHub and send us the link.
● Try to be platform independent, in other words the project must be runnable
easily in every environment.

========================================================
Services are implemented.

mvn install is working. 
Additionally you can run service by using spring-boot:run command. This will run in memory tomcat instance and services become available on localhost:8080

In test package you can find GameOfThreeGameControllerImplTest:
	It covers one game setup part and one full game with moves.
	
GameOfThreeGameControllerImpl is planned as main game controller. an be injected as a Service annotated Spring class. Main purpose is to control other in memory games according to requirements and game rules.	
ba.enox.codesample.gameofthree.api.GameOfThreeRestAPIController can be used to wrap implementation with restful api
